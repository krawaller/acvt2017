<p> 
<strong><big>Jump on enemies.</big></strong> Often, this is the only way to defeat them. Koopas (the turtle-like creatures) and Buzzy Beetles will turn into a shell when jumped on. Hitting the shell will send it gliding. You will get extra points if it hits other enemies. 
Goombas can be defeated when stepped on, but you'll have to butt bounce if you have mini Mario. 
You can shoot fire at most enemies as well (and get a coin as a reward). However, 
shooting fire at Dry Bones has no effect. Step on Dry Bones to stun him for a short while.
